Description:

1) This is an application to demonstrate/visualize sorting algorithms.
2) <ncurses.h> library is used for GUI.
3) Three sorting algorithms are available: Bubble Sort, Quicksort and Selection Sort.
4) On the main menu screen, the user can choose any of the above mentioned algorithms.
5) After making a selection, the user is shown a brief description and the space and time complexities of the sorting algorithm selected.
6) On the next screen, the user is given an option to input the number of elements (numbers) to perform sorting on. The constraint is that the    user should enter a number between 2 and 10, both inclusive.
7) The numbers are then randomly generated and displayed on the screen.
8) When the user presses <ENTER>, the animation starts. The user controls the animation using the <RIGHT ARROW KEY>.
9) The user is shown how the sorting takes place, the current iteration number and how the numbers get swapped, compared, etc.
10) After the animation is completed, the number of swaps and comparisons that took place while sorting are shown to the user.
11) Next, the main menu is displayed and the user can choose a sorting algorithm or exit.
12) Also, for the users' comfort, an option to return to the main menu has been added on all screens.
