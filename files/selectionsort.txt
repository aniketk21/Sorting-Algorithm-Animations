Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sort. The algorithm
 
divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items
 
already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be
 
sorted that occupy the rest of the list. The algorithm
 
proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on
 
sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging
 
(swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting 
 
it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one
 
element to the right.
