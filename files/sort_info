1) Bubble Sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort
, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps
through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of
adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the
wrong order.

2) Quicksort, also known as partition-exchange sort,
is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a
systematic method for placing the elements of an
array in order. It was developed by Tony Hoare in
1959.

3) Selection sort is an in-place comparison sort.
The min or max element is selected from the
unsorted elements.
