Bubble Sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple
 
sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be
 
sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if
 
they are in the wrong order.
 
 
 
TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 
 
Worst case performance                  O(n^2)
 
Best case performance                   O(n)
 
Average case performance                O(n^2)
 
Worst case space complexity             O(1) auxiliary
