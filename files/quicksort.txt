Quicksort, also known as partition-exchange sort, is an
 
efficient sorting algorithm. It is a divide and conquer
 
algorithm. It was developed by Tony Hoare in 1959. 
 
The steps are:
 
1. Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array.
 
2. Reorder the array so that all elements with values less
   than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements
   with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal
   values can go either way). After this partitioning, the
   pivot is in its final position. This is called the 
   partition operation.
 
3. Recursively apply the above steps to the two sub-arrays.
 
 
TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 
Worst case performance                  O(n^2)
 
Best case performance                   O(n log n)
 
Average case performance                O(n log n)
